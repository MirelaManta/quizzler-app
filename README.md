## Trivia True-False App
__Code related to the quiz-game repo, but leveled up.__  
Most notable changes I've made:
* I created the Graphical User Interface as a class called QuizInterface, with its attributes (window, widgets) from tkinter package and the methods needed;
* The question_data list is no longer hardcoded, but the questions are fetched by a request to the trivia API (Open Trivia Database); 
  * giving as parameters the number of questions, category and type.
* Apart from that, I've made the necessary adjustments to make the project work after implementing the changes.
